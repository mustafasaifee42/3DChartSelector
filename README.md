# 3DChartSelector
A poster to assist designers to select the appropriate 3D chart/graph for data visualisations

Based on the user tasks and data type, 3D Chart Selector helps designers form an initial idea on which chart to use. This is only focused on 3D visualization and inspired from [Financial Times Visual Vocabulary](https://github.com/ft-interactive/chart-doctor/tree/master/visual-vocabulary)
